CS4430 - Group Project

We are going to design a standard library inventory tracking system using C# as the base language and MySQL as the DBMS. The initial intended user is from the perspective of an employee at a library. This means that we will, at least in the beginning, not focusing on customer / member driven features, and focussing mainly on employee related features. This would, for example, be like seeing what books are currently checked out, seeing what books are in stock, placing an order for new books, etc. The UI will allow search results to be filtered by Author, Date published, genre (non-fiction, fiction, sci-fi, etc.).

We plan to impliment the following features initially, with a possability of adding more assuming we have enough time.

- Book Tracking / inventory tracking
	- Books on reserve and Due date tracking
- LIM (Library Inventory Management)
- Database Logging / Action Logging
- Security focused employee accounts
	- employees must log in before proceeding with the application

If time allows:
- Individual user accounts
- User Feedback
